Slider render()
    children  map    copy     emitMouse -> this.onMouseDown
    onMouseDown
        onStart
            found handle    onSlideStart      sets this.active.
            else handleRailAndTrackClicks.(maybe set this.active too?)
                getUpdatedHandles(curr, updateKey, updateValue, reversed)
                    submitUpdate



Handle
    onMouseDown   props.onMouseDown, props.emitMouse(e, id)
                                        which goes to slider.onMouseDown
    .. onTouchStart onKeyDown

Rail
    onMouseDown   props.onMouseDown, props.emitMouse(e)

Track
    onMouseDown   props.onMouseDown, props.emitMouse(e)


add mouseMove to Rail, track?    


///////
Why need to remove eventlisteners in mouseUp as well as componentwillunmount?

onStart has isTouch. Maybe use same style for onMouseMove/onTouchMove.   -- turn into onMove.
why does cloneElement send handles to element types other than Handles ?


// for tooltip:
don't do removeEventListener 'mousemove' in onMouseUp. Maybe just an isMouseDown.
